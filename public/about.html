<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Michelle and I live in a small town in the middle of nowwhere and so happy for it. For the last couple years
     I have been blessed with the opportunity to be a stay at home mom and wife. And let me tell you thats a job 
     all on its own and I love every minute of it. Well ok almost every minute of it. No matter what your "job" is
     at this time, It just takes hard work, paitence, understanding, and desire to succeed.</p>
  
  <p>When looking back from when I got my very first job to what I'm doing now I sure have a variety of tools on my tool belt.
    In the food industry where my very first job was a waitress in the small town I grew up in. Which led me on the path of working 
    in a few different resturants over a few years. During that time I went from waiting tables to managing waitstaff and bartenders.
    I dabbled in hvac for a bit from that I can now do some of my own repairs on our home. Being blessed with oppurtunity to help 
    teach preschool, which allowed be to have 3 of my children in my classrorom when they were at that age level. Not sure if my kids 
    always loved that though. Working in the Retail Industry as a cashier in a shoe store to making my way up to running my own depts
    in one of the big box stores.

  <p>The knowlwedge I have gained from my different jobs I feel has played a part in my hobbies/intrests. From being outdoors in my garden which 
    provides for our family all year, kayak camping trips, refurbishing old furniture, working on the remodel of our old home to 
    volunteering my time and talents at our chuch.
